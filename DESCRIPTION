Description: The DEGRE is an R package constructed to identify Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in RNA-Seq experiments with random effects. These effects are identified previously in the experimental design matrix. The DEGRE tool has the implementation of pre-processing steps to clean the count matrix of the gene reads, and it uses the Generalized Linear Mixed Model with the negative binomial distribution to infer the DEGs.
