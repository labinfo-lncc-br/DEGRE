Description: The DEGRE is an R package that aims to identify Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in a pairwise manner and considers the insertion of the individuals' random effects in the experimental design. This package has a preprocessing step responsible for filtering genes that could impair DEGsâ€™ inference. For this purpose, DEGRE uses Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with the negative binomial distribution.
